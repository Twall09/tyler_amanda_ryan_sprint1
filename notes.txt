This project overall wasn't too bad. To help us, we used resources such as teacher materials,
ChatGPT, and youtube videos. Everything seemed to work and fall into place, however, we had
some difficulty with screen adjustments and form submissions. 

For the screen adjustments, we tried multiple things so the page would adjust to different devices,
however, it was difficult to get it to adjust to different screen sizes. For example, some of the pages,
you may have to zoom out a little so everything lines up properly. The links and search bar should work 
fine. 

For the form submission, we used DOM and we were able to get a confirmation note on top of the page, along 
with the title and features. However, our results would either show up as "null" or "HTMLParagraphElement".
